*This policy was last modified on 8th of January 2024 (8.1.2024, January 8th 2024)*

## Introduction

This policy, published by Silverzone Oy (referred to as “Silverzone” or “we” or “our” and its affiliates), outlines the rights of Content Creators ("you") and our liabilities regarding the creation of content related to our products.

## Who qualifies as a Content Creator

A Content Creator, within the scope of this policy, refers to any individual, group, organization, or entity producing content, including videos, reviews, live content, fan art, or other derivative works on platforms such as YouTube, Twitch, personal blogs, news, or other available media.

## Your rights and liabilities

As a Content Creator, you own all rights to your content, including sound or visual effects affiliated with it. However, you do not own rights to the product or its contents.

You have the right to sell or commercialize your works, such as fan art or videos, provided that you do not:
- Claim to represent Silverzone
- Sell or market your works as "official"
- Clearly label your creations (e.g., fan art and reviews) with appropriate labels

Content Creators own non-exclusive rights, allowing Silverzone to use the content for promotional purposes with attribution.

You agree not to impersonate Silverzone or endanger our brand.

## Our rights and liabilities

We own and reserve all rights to the product and our brand (See: [Brand Guidelines](link-to-brand-guidelines)) and may request the removal of content if it:
- Infringes on our copyrights or trademarks
- Endangers our brand
- Impersonates us
- Is produced in an obviously malicious manner and against the law

Adherence to Silverzone's brand guidelines is encouraged for positive brand representation.

## Application of this policy

This policy applies to all Content Creators and their content, unless a prior agreement or contract is made with Silverzone.

In case of conflict between this policy and any prior agreement or contract with Silverzone, the terms of the prior agreement or contract supersede those of this policy.

## License grant

Silverzone grants the rights outlined in this policy to all Content Creators, including a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to create and share content related to our products.

## Termination

If you are found to be in violation of this policy, we may revoke your license to create content from our Intellectual Property and request a takedown of your content.

## Changes to this policy

Silverzone will communicate policy changes through official channels; Content Creators are responsible for staying updated.
